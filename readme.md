**The latest learning procedure**

Create a separate folder for each LeetCode question

Folder name follow `<Question Number>. <Question Name>`

Inside each folder:
   1. GenSol.py *General Solution*
   2. CnE.py *Crack and Expand the knowledge*
   3. PDF/Markdown file to explain each step in detail *(optioanl)*

Inside .py file:
   ```python 
   '''
